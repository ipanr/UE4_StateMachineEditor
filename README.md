# V_ITD

This project modifies a data table of an structure of STR_State that presents all the states that are accesible for each individual state.

Use UEW_ModifyStates to modify the information of the data table DT_MainCharacterStates. 

After saving, reimport the data table to see the changes reflected in the editor.

To add a new state, modify ENUM_States and recompile the project. Make sure STR_State and STR_AccesibleStates are compiled.

To add new detections, modify STR_ListOfDetections and recompile the project.
